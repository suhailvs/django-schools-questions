An advantage of using solar power is,no greenhouse gases, lots of pollution, it is available even on cloudy days, 1
An advantage of using hydroelectric power is,reservoirs can be used for irrigation of crops, sometimes surrounding area get flooded, the normal flow of the water is diverted, 1
Most utility companies in the U.S. dont use hydroelectric power because,the plants are expensive to build and use expensive machinery,reservoirs can be used to irrigate crops and they dont want to help farmers,the cause a lot of greenhouse gass, 1
Which energy source would be best for a city that has limited space and want to be effecient?,solar-costly to build and 6%-30% efficient, Wind-turbines need lots of free space 40%-60% efficient,Natural gas-can be used in small areas 50%-60% efficient, 3
What is a major disadvantage of nuclear power?,it produces small amounts of power, the by-product(waste) is nuclear radiation,power plants are inexpensive to build, 2
If a community were choosing between solar and wind; what advantage would make wind the best choice?,locations for turbines are limited because the wind can be blocked,solar needs a back up system for cloudy days; some days there is no wind to move the turbines blades,wind energy is less expensive and it is limitless, 3
An advantage of burning coal for energy is,it is an inexpensive source of energy, it does not pollute the air, it is a renewable energy source, 1
An advantage of using natural gas as a form of energy is,it is more expensive compared to other fossil fuels,It produces low emissions(pollution) compared to other fossil fuels,there is a more limited supply compared to other fossil fuels, 2
What do geothermal and solar energy have in common?,they both use sunlight to generate energy, both are non-renewable energy sources,neither produce greenhouse gass, 3
